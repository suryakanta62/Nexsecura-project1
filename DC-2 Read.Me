CTF Challenge:- Cracking The DC-2 Machine

Hello, LinkedIn Network!

On the 3-month & 25 days journey of cybersecurity. In the 18th task of the CTF machine, this machine is intermediate compared to the first machine, but harder than the other machines.
I am so grateful to understand these machines and the tools used in these CTF challenges.

🔐 DC-2 CTF Challenge | Capture The Flag Walkthrough 🎯:-

 Proud to share my experience in solving the DC-2 vulnerable machine – part of the DC series from VulnHub designed for practicing penetration testing and privilege escalation.

🖥️ Machine Details:-

Name: DC-2
Difficulty: Intermediate
Platform: VulnHub (Boot2Root)
Goal: Capture the root flag (/root/flag.txt)
IP Address: [Your assigned IP during the challenge]

📌 Challenge Overview:-

DC-2 is a vulnerable Linux-based machine that simulates a real-world scenario for attackers to exploit web vulnerabilities, gain initial access, enumerate users, and escalate to root.

🛠️ Tools Used:-

Nmap 🧭 – for port scanning
Gobuster / Dirb 🔍 – for directory brute-forcing
Nikto – for web server vulnerability scan
Hydra – for brute-force attacks
Netcat – for reverse shells
LinPEAS – for privilege escalation enumeration

🧭 Walkthrough Steps:-

1)Nmap Scan:-
 Discovered open ports: 80 (HTTP) and 22 (SSH)
nmap -sV -sC -Pn [target IP]

2)Web Enumeration:-
Visited http://[IP] – saw a basic webpage with clues.
Used gobuster to find hidden directories like /blog/ and /wp-login.php → confirmed WordPress is running.

3)User Enumeration on WordPress:-
Used wpscan and author enumeration → found a user named elliot.

4)Brute-force WordPress Login:-
Used hydra to brute-force the login:
hydra -l elliot -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt [IP] http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^:Invalid"

5)Gained WP Dashboard Access:-
Used the plugin editor to inject a PHP reverse shell.

6)Reverse Shell Access:-
Uploaded and triggered the reverse shell → got access as www-data.

7)Privilege Escalation:-
Used linpeas.sh to scan the system.
Found a readable user.txt and privilege escalation path via SUID binaries or misconfigured cron jobs.

8)Escalated to Root:-
Exploited vulnerable script or service.
Accessed /root/flag.txt.

🧠 Key Takeaways:-

The power of web enumeration and WordPress vulnerabilities is critical in initial access.
Brute-forcing credentials is still effective in poorly secured environments.
Automated tools like LinPEAS simplify privilege escalation discovery.
Hands-on practice sharpens your real-world pentesting skills.
