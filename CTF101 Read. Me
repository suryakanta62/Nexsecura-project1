üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è CTF101 Walkthrough | My Cybersecurity Learning Journey

 Challenge Overview:-
 
CTF101 is an entry-level Capture The Flag challenge designed to strengthen fundamental cybersecurity skills like reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation. It‚Äôs a great starting point for beginners stepping into the world of penetration testing.

 Tools Used:-

1)Nmap ‚Üí For initial reconnaissance and port scanning
2)Dirsearch / Gobuster ‚Üí Directory and file enumeration
3)Nikto ‚Üí Vulnerability scanning of web applications
4)Hydra ‚Üí Brute force login attempts
5)Netcat ‚Üí Reverse shell interaction

 My Walkthrough Steps:-
 
1Ô∏è‚É£ Performed Nmap scan to identify open ports and services.
 2Ô∏è‚É£ Used directory brute-forcing to find hidden files and login pages.
 3Ô∏è‚É£ Discovered weak credentials using Hydra on the login form.
 4Ô∏è‚É£ Gained initial access and uploaded a reverse shell.
 5Ô∏è‚É£ Explored the system, gathered flags, and escalated privileges.
 6Ô∏è‚É£ Successfully captured the final root flag. üö©

 Key Takeaway:-
 
CTF101 highlighted the importance of methodical enumeration and basic exploitation techniques. Even simple misconfigurations can expose critical vulnerabilities. This challenge strengthened my foundation for tackling more advanced CTFs.
