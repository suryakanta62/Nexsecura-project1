DC-3 Machine CTF 

Another step in my CTF journey! The DC-3 machine was a great way to sharpen my skills in enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation. This 
ctf challenge to increase the ability to solve the machine.

The DC series is a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge designed for security enthusiasts to practice penetration testing and ethical hacking skills. DC-3 focuses on web exploitation, privilege escalation, and enumeration techniques.

🚩 DC-3 CTF Machine Walkthrough:-

Recently, I completed the DC-3 CTF machine, which was a great exercise to sharpen my penetration testing and privilege escalation skills.

🔎 Challenge Overview:-

1Difficulty: Intermediate
2)Objective: Gain root access and capture the flag.
3)Skills Tested: Web enumeration, SQL injection, privilege escalation, Linux enumeration.

🛠️ Tools Used:-

1)Nmap → Service & port scanning
2)Gobuster → Directory brute forcing
3)Burp Suite → Testing SQL injection
4)Hydra → Password brute force
5)Linpeas / Manual enumeration → Privilege escalation

📝 My Walkthrough:-

1)Reconnaissance – Used nmap to identify open ports (HTTP, SSH).
2)Enumeration – Ran gobuster to discover hidden directories and files.
3)Web Exploitation – Found a login form vulnerable to SQL injection → gained admin access.
4)Foothold – Uploaded a reverse shell through the vulnerable web application.
5)Privilege Escalation – Enumerated the system and identified a misconfigured SUID binary that allowed privilege escalation.
6)Root Access – Exploited the misconfiguration to escalate privileges and captured the root flag.

🎯 Key Takeaways:-

Always perform thorough enumeration—hidden services often hold the key.
SQL injection vulnerabilities are still highly impactful when overlooked.
Privilege escalation requires careful system analysis—misconfigurations are powerful attack vectors.
Real-world systems often combine multiple small weaknesses that lead to full compromise.

 This challenge reinforced the importance of structured methodology: Enumerate → Exploit → Escalate → Capture.
