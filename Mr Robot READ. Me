🚩 Mr. Robot CTF Walkthrough | Vulnhub Machine 🚩

 Challenge Overview:-

 The Mr. Robot CTF is a beginner-to-intermediate level machine hosted on Vulnhub, inspired by the famous Mr. Robot TV series. The objective is to gain root access and capture the 3 hidden keys while exploring real-world exploitation techniques.

 Tools Used:-

1)Nmap → For service and port scanning
2)Gobuster / Dirsearch → Directory enumeration
3)Nikto → Web server scanning
4)Hydra → Brute-forcing credentials
5)Netcat → Reverse shell connection
6)Linux Privilege Escalation techniques → For root access

 Walkthrough Steps:-
 
1️⃣ Enumeration: Started with nmap to identify open ports → HTTP & SSH.
 2️⃣ Web Exploration: Found a WordPress-like site and used gobuster for directory fuzzing → revealed a hidden WordPress login.
 3️⃣ Credential Discovery: Extracted leaked credentials from wordlists inspired by Mr. Robot.
 4️⃣ Exploitation: Logged into WordPress admin → uploaded a reverse shell via theme editor.
 5️⃣ Initial Foothold: Caught the reverse shell with Netcat.
 6️⃣ Privilege Escalation: Identified misconfigured files and escalated to root.
 7️⃣ Captured All 3 Keys: User.txt, Robot.txt, and Root.txt. 🎯

 Key Takeaways:-

Enumeration is the backbone of every CTF and real-world pentest.
Always check hidden directories, configuration files, and default credentials.
Privilege escalation requires patience and careful system analysis.
The Mr. Robot CTF is an excellent beginner-friendly challenge to practice real-world attack paths.

 Completing this sharpened my skills in web exploitation, privilege escalation, and enumeration strategies—crucial for penetration testing.
