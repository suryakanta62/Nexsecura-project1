CTF Challenge :- Cracking The Brute Me Machine

Hello, LinkedIn Network!

On the 4-month 5-day journey of cybersecurity. In the 19th task of the CTF machine challenge, to solve these machines, brute-force and basic enumeration methods were used. These machines can perform tasks like this in CTF challenges.

“Brute Me” CTF Machine walkthrough:-

🔐 Brute Me CTF Challenge | Walkthrough & Learning Highlights 🎯:-

🖥️ Machine: Brute Me
 🎯 Challenge Type: Capture the Flag (CTF) – Focused on brute-force attacks and basic enumeration.

⚙️ Challenge Overview:-

"Brute Me" is a beginner-friendly CTF machine that emphasizes web application brute-forcing techniques. The goal is to identify login credentials and escalate access to retrieve the final flag.

🛠️ Tools Used:-

Nmap – Port scanning and service enumeration
Dirb / Gobuster – Directory brute-forcing
Hydra – Brute-forcing login credentials
Browser (Firefox) – Manual testing & UI interaction

🚶‍♂️ My Walkthrough Steps:-

1)Recon with Nmap:-

 Identified open ports: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP)

2)Web Enumeration:-
 
Accessed the webpage → Basic login form found
 Used Gobuster to brute force directories → Discovered hidden paths

3)Brute-force Login:-

 Intercepted login request using Burp Suite
 Used Hydra to brute-force with rockyou.txt
 Discovered valid credentials: admin:password123

4)Post-login Access:-
 
Logged in, found hidden message or file
 Accessed internal dashboard revealing the flag

🔑 Key Takeaway:-

This machine emphasizes the power of methodical brute-forcing and manual validation during reconnaissance. It’s a great reminder to never overlook simple weak passwords and to always test HTTP forms thoroughly.
