NACOS CTF Walkthrough

 This CTF walkthrough helps to increase confidence and learn a new skill. This challenge was a great exercise to enhance my skills in enumeration, exploiting misconfigured web applications, and privilege escalation techniques.

*Platform: Vulnhub / CTF Lab

*Objective: Capture the root flag by exploiting misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in the Nacos service.

*Difficulty: Intermediate (requires knowledge of enumeration, RCE exploitation, and privilege escalation).

The Nacos CTF machine is a Capture The Flag challenge focused on web exploitation and misconfigurations. It revolves around identifying weak configurations in Apache/Nginx services, understanding directory traversal, and exploiting misconfigured APIs to escalate privileges and gain system access.

 Challenge Overview:-

1)The objective of the Nacos challenge is to:
Enumerate the web services and hidden endpoints.
2)Identify vulnerable API endpoints.
3)Exploit misconfigurations to gain initial foothold.
4)Escalate privileges to obtain the final flag.

This challenge primarily enhances skills in reconnaissance, web penetration testing, and privilege escalation.

 Tools Used:-

1)Nmap â†’ For service and port scanning
2)Gobuster / Dirb â†’ Directory brute forcing
3)Curl / Burp Suite â†’ Inspecting and exploiting API requests
4)Hydra â†’ Password brute forcing (if applicable)
5)Netcat â†’ Reverse shell handling
6)Linux Privilege Escalation techniques

 My Walkthrough (Step-by-Step):-

1)Enumeration with Nmap â†’ Discovered open ports (HTTP service on 8848).
2)Directory brute force â†’ Found /nacos endpoint hosting the Nacos config console.
3)Authentication bypass â†’ Observed weak/no authentication on API endpoints.
4)Exploiting configuration leak â†’ Retrieved database credentials from exposed configs.
5)Database access â†’ Extracted sensitive data and verified login credentials.
6)Reverse shell â†’ Used the credentials to gain foothold on the target machine.
7)Privilege Escalation â†’ Exploited SUID binaries / misconfigured permissions to escalate to root.
8)Captured the Flag ðŸŽ¯

 Key Takeaways:-

âœ… Importance of thorough enumeration in uncovering hidden endpoints.
 âœ… Misconfigured Nacos API endpoints can directly leak sensitive information.
 âœ… Real-world lesson: Always secure configuration panels with proper authentication & access control.
 âœ… Reinforced skills in recon, API exploitation, and privilege escalation.
