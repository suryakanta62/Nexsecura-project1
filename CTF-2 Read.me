CTF Challenge:- Solving Hackathon-2 

Hello, LinkedIn Network!

On the 3-month & 5-day journey of cybersecurity. I am very thrilled to solve the new machine & learn a new challenge, how to solve these machines & how to use the tool in this CTF challenge.
Other than these, the machine is very hard, but their tool are very important - dirsearch,gobuster, hydra,ftp. 

🚩 Challenge Overview:-

Hackathon-2 is a CTF-style vulnerable machine designed to assess your ability to perform enumeration, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation techniques. The box mimics a real-world scenario where multiple footholds must be leveraged to escalate to root.

🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used:-

1)nmap – for initial port scanning and service enumeration
2)gobuster – to discover hidden directories
3)Nikto – for web vulnerability scanning
4)Hydra – for brute-force attacks (if applicable)
5)Dirsearch- for directory searching.

🗝️ Key step in my walkthrough :-

1)Enumeration:-
Port scanning reveals open ports (typically HTTP and SSH).
Web service hosts a vulnerable login panel or file upload interface.

2)Initial Access :-
Exploited web vulnerability (e.g., LFI, RCE, or weak credentials).
Gained a reverse shell via upload or command injection.

3)Privilege Escalation:-
Found a cron job or SUID binary running as root.
Used misconfigured scripts or kernel exploits to escalate privileges.

4)Capture the Flag:-
Accessed /root/root.txt or /home/user/user.txt containing the final flag.

🎯 Key Takeaways:-
Importance of deep enumeration on both services and web applications.
Web exploitation is often the entry point — understanding common web flaws is crucial.
Privilege escalation requires attention to OS-level misconfigurations.
Hackathon-2 is a solid intermediate CTF that strengthens real-world pentesting skills.
